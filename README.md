# Image-Processing-

This repository contains the Image Processing Project developed for CS 341 in Spring 2024. This project focuses on manipulating images in the Portable Pix Map (PPM) format using F# for functional programming and C# for a console-based interface. The project aims to explore various image processing techniques, including applying filters and transforming images.

Features
The following image processing features are implemented:

Sepia Filter: Applies a sepia filter to each pixel using specific mathematical formulas, giving the image a warm, vintage look.
Increase Intensity: Boosts the intensity of the red, green, or blue channels based on a specified scaling factor.
Flip Horizontal: Reverses the image horizontally, swapping the left and right sides while preserving the RGB order.
Rotate 180 Degrees: Rotates the image upside down, producing a mirrored effect.
Edge Detection: Detects edges in the image by comparing adjacent pixels and replaces each pixel with black or white.
Technology
Languages: The backend processing is implemented in F# while the console-based interface is developed in C#.
PPM Format: The project uses the PPM format, a simple, human-readable image file format that represents pixels in ASCII.
Requirements
Implemented using functional programming principles: no loops, arrays, or mutable variables.
Function signatures must remain unchanged to align with the provided starter code.
Efficient solutions using recursion, higher-order functions, and functional programming paradigms.
